Position is used to keep an element at certain position in viewport
There are 5 positions in CSS
1.static: it is the default position and it does not have any impact of top,bottom,left,right
2.Relative : it makes an element move left or right or top or bottom from its previous position
3.Absolute: it makes an element move left or right or top or bottom from the body perspective
4.fixed: it is similar to Absolute but it will not have any impact of scrolling
5. sticky: it is nothing but Relative + fixed. it gets fixed after specific position/point

In case two elements with similar position collides for a specific point, then the one with more Z-index will overrides other
