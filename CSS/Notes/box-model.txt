Box model is considered as the heart of css. Every element in Web page is considered as a BOX.  A box contains
1. border : outline/outermost line of a box/element
eg: border: width type color;
we can also specify borders for left/right/top/bottom separetly

The corner radius can be given by border-radius: size;
you can also mention border-top-left-radius , border-top-right-radius,border-bottom-left-radius,border-bottom-right-radius

2. padding:
padding is the gap between border and content inside the box
padding-left,padding-right,padding-bottom,padding-top can be used for spefic paddings;
padding: size; size will be given for all sides
padding: size1 size2; size 1 will be given for top and bottom, size2 will be given for left and right;
padding: size1 size2 size3 size4; top right bottom left

There is a chance that padding might increase actual height/width of a box, to avoid it use box-sizing:border-box

3. margin: margin is similar to padding but it gives space outside the box
