How do you apply CSS to HTML?
There are 3 ways
i. inline CSS: mention css properties as "style" as a attribute in the line line of element is inline CSS.
<h1 style="background-color: red;">Heading 1</h1>

ii. internal CSS: we can mention CSS Properties with "style" as a element in the head of HTML
<style>
   selector
   {
    //properties
   }
</style>

selector is the way styling can recognize the elements
basic selectors are tag name,class name,id name
classname have .classname selector
id have #idname selector
id>class>tag name
Inline CSS > Internal CSS

iii. External CSS: you can even mention all CSS as a external file called External CSS

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css" />


Comment in css is /* and ends with */


selectors are three types
tag name 
class name ----> .
id name ----> #
id> class > tag
