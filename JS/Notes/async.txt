Javascript is a synchrounous single threaded programming lanaguage

Any Function that takes time to run is Asynchronous Function
Every Asynchronous function will return Promise
A Promise is an object to describe an eventual completion of an Asynchronous operation

API(Application Programming Interface):
Backend connected to Database will create an API endpoint that consists data in XML/JSON format
https://api.quotable.io/random , in this url is https://api.quotable.io  and /random is called endpoint

To solve the pronelm of promise chaining and to address promises in synchronous way , we use async await
Every function , to uses await must be declared with async keyword and await keyword makes the statement wait until promise resolves

async function something()
{
    const result= await 
    new Promise((resolve,reject)=>setTimeout(resolve("hello world"),5000))
    console.log(result)
}
