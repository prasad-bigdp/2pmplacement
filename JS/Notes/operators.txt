let a=20;
a+=2 ==> a=a+2
4.logical operators: logical operators are used to make combined conditional logics
&&, ||, !

incr/decr have two variations Pre and post 
6. unary + : unary plus is used to convert any value into number
+"26"  will become number 26
7. ternary operator/conditional operator:
let a= (10>25) ? "abc" : "xyz" ;
